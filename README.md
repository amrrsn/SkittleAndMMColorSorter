# SkittleAndMMColorSorter
 These files are my final submission for a class project.

I don't have the time to make this ReadMe look pretty, but if you wish to understand the workings of the code, the M&M code has many more comments and goes a bit more in depth about why I did things the way I did.

The code currently is designed with these sub-circuits in mind:
+ Arduino Uno R3
+ TCS34725 Color Sensor (Specifically the Breakout Board created by Adafruit)
+ SG90 Servo Motor

In addition to that, this code was made with these libraries:
+ Adafruit TCS34725 v1.3.1
+ Servo v1.1.6

Eventually I might upload the SolidWorks and/or DraftSight Files used to create the physical sorter, but those require some work before being uploaded to the internet.

Thanks to the good folks over at: https://github.com/systembolaget/Physical-computing-sensor-servo-tutorial-6a-Colour-finder-with-ams-TCS34725-and-HD-1900A

Their code may have sent me on many un-used rabbit holes, but it taught me a lot, and many of their comments and base code still remain.
